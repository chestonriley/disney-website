                <p>Okay, now time to go to the parks!  But hold on just a second… what do I need to know?  First of all, the beginning of May is a lot better for crowds than the middle of June, but the parks are ALWAYS crowded.  Mentally preparing for lots of people is essential.  In addition, Disney draws tourists from all over the world.  Some cultures have a corner-stone of good manners, and others do not.  So be prepared for pushy people and try not to take it personally.</p>
                <p>Getting to Magic Kingdom is also a gigantic headache.  If you go to the “main entrance”, that’s only the beginning.  You will then either have to ride the monorail or the ferry to the actual park entrance.  Both ways keep moving, but just prepare for about 30-40 minutes of additional time to actually get into the park.  We are actually going to try to take a taxi to the Disney Contemporary Resort this year, and then walk to Magic Kingdom.  We’ve not tried this before, but it seems like it will work.</p>
                <p>Next, consider bringing a single backpack for you and your family, equipped with several items that are essential:</p>
                <ul id="park_list">
                    <li>A poncho for everyone.  May is not a wet month in Florida, but it’s good to be prepared.  You might want to consider and extra one to drape over a stroller as well.</li>
                    <li>A water bottle.  The days get hot and humid, and keeping hydrated is a must for continual magical fun.  But water (along with everything else) costs.  You might consider bringing a water bottle and filling up at the fountains.</li>
                    <li>Fan/water mister.  You can pick one of these up at <a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/O2Cool-Deluxe-Misting-Fan-Teal/43980198?action=product_interest&action_type=title&item_id=43980198&placement_id=irs-106-t1&strategy=PWVUB&visitor_id&category=&client_guid=603d4b96-922d-418c-aa50-fb3bc26dfe7c&customer_id_enc&config_id=106&parent_item_id=34416185&parent_anchor_item_id=34416185&guid=65832f76-b295-4364-a9f4-612ee1bc4516&bucket_id=irsbucketdefault&beacon_version=1.0.1&findingMethod=p13n">Walmart</a> for a LOT cheaper than you will spend in the park.  But this is nearly a must-have.  The kidos will get hot, and the instant cooling for them will be welcomed.</li>
                    <li>Magic Bands, tickets, wallet with credit cards and some cash, and definitely an ID card.</li>
                    <li>Mobile phone.  Definitely make sure your phone is fully charged at the beginning of the day.</li>
                    <li>Hat or visor and sunglasses.  Do NOT forget these for the kids.  The Florida sun is bright and hot!</li>
                    <li>Snacks.  It’s okay to bring some small snacks into the park.  Go ahead and have some on hand.</li>
                    <li>Sunscreen.  This should almost be a given.  And this ain't Holiday World... no free sunscreen for all.</li>
                    <li>Clothes.  Consider and extra change of clothes for the kids.  There are several places where playing in water is possible.  You might even consider bringing (or wearing) a swimsuit.</li>
                    <li>Zip-lock bags.  Helps keep things organized and dry in your backpack.</li>
                    <li>Wet-wipes.  Mommies know all about this.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you use your mobile phone to take video, it will RAPIDLY lose battery life for 2 reasons.  First, filming itself eats up more battery than just being on standby.  Secondly (at least with iPhone), the phone will continually try to sync-up video with “the cloud”.  The constant attempts will rapidly drain your battery.  So set yourself up for filming success by changing the setting on your phone to prevent it from trying to sync up.  Also, consider buying a mobile charging pack so that you can recharge without having to find an outlet and waiting for your phone to do it’s business.</p>

                <p>Your magic band is your key to access.  It will get you into the park (once activated).  In addition, you will be required to scan it to access your pre-arranged FastPass+ appointments.  Once you have exhausted (or canceled) your existing FastPass’s, you can get more.  You can either go to the ride and scan your magic band and receive a return time, OR you can visit a FassPass kiosk to arrange a FastPass at a particular time.  Remember that you can only have ONE FastPass reservation at a time (except for the previously reserved FastPass+), so choose wisely.  Finally, when showing up for your ride experience, ensure that you meet your appointed time.  You can’t get through early, and being late will cancel your FastPass.  Make sure that you find the FastPass entrance as well.  Don’t get in the long line… that’s why you got the FastPass in the first place!</p>
                <p>Disney does not make it difficult to buy anything.  Main Street USA in Magic Kingdom is lined with shops and vendors, and designed to lure in the adults through the excited children.  Be prepared with your “no” strategy ahead of time.  We typically tell Luke that he can buy 2 things while at Disney, and that he should take his time to identify things.  In addition, if your little one sees something in the park, chances are that it is available at Downtown Disney.  Promising to get it later is a great because it prevents you from carting something around in the park all day, and perhaps they’ll forget about it (yeah right!) or chose something else later.</p>
                <p>The heat and humidity WILL drain you, kinda like living in the Ohio Valley.  Make sure that you get a good night’s sleep the day before the park.  Also, think about what your afternoon strategy will be.  Consider going back to the resort.  You can also take a break by riding the monorail (for free) to a Disney Resort (like the Polynesian or the Grand Floridian) and finding a place to sit and get something the drink and relax for a while.  Don’t worry…you don’t need to scan your magic band to visit a resort.  The important thing is that you formulate your plan for afternoon cooling off, nap and relaxation time.  This is especially important if you plan to go back to the park later in the day.  Charging through is a recipe for kindergartener-meltdown disaster.</p>
                <p>The parades are a double-edged sword as well.  If you plan to watch the parades, by all means keep track of the time and get a good viewing spot ahead of time.  If, however, you are not, you can get stuck trying to wind your way past them.  At Magic Kingdom, Main Street USA will be shut down periodically for a parade.  If you find Main Street between you and your next FassPass during that time, you will spend a lot of extra time trying to get around the parade.</p>
                <p>Being in the parks is great fun, but being not being prepared can quickly drain all the magic away.  Visit a few websites that have tips/tricks as well!</p>
