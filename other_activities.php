                <p>Obviously one of the main reasons that people visit Walt Disney World is for the parks.  However, there are plenty of other things to do (and spend money on!).</p>
                <p>Downtown Disney is our family daily outing of choice for sure.  Besides the huge number of restaurants, there is a kid-train ride (Luke has declared that he is too big for that now, but we’ll see) and a carousel that the kids can ride.  For your sweet tooth, it also includes the Goofy Candy Store, the Ghirardelli Chocolate Shop (GREAT ice cream and shakes).  Shopping of course, with the Disney Christmas Shop being one of our favorites, and a number of toy and souvenir stores.  Finally, Raglan Road Irish Pub has great Irish Music and dancing.  Downtown Disney is almost always crowded, but if you plan to take your time and just relax, it’s a pretty fun place to hang out. </p>
                <p>
The Disney Resorts can also be really fun places to visit as well.  You could spend hours visiting resorts and walking around.  Disney really “does it right” in terms of making a magical experience for their guests, and taking in some of the experiences that the resorts have to offer can be fun as well.  You never know what new things you might find, and we are always surprised!</p>
                <p>Disney World has a couple of miniature golf courses as well.  They are hardly ever crowded, and can be a good way to take some downtime without the crowds.</p>
                <p>One little known secret is that the Disney World Fire Department (yes, their own one on the property) is happy to give tours to the kids.  It’s a very clean (Disney standards) place that will feed and awestruck toddler for at least an hour.  Best part:  NO ONE does this, so you will be by yourself.</p>
                <p>And of course don’t forget the pools!  The Bonnet Creek Resort has several pools, and they are definitely kid friendly.</p>
                <p>I would say that more than half of our fun has been exploring.  Again, we visit Disney World for the parks, but our family intimacy has always been fueled by finding new things.   Find some real jewel experiences by:</p>
                <p>I would say to consider the following list of items:</p>
                <ul id="pack_list">
                    <li>Visiting a Disney World resort and then just getting on another bus to somewhere else.  You can always call a cab to get back to Bonnet Creek.</li>
                    <li>Do searches on “secrets” or “tips” on the internet</li>
                    <li>Do a little exploring on the Disney World website</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The important thing is to take advantage of the time that you have to do some exploring.  Try to be a little flexible with your schedule on the non-park days as well.  Eat when you are hungry, and rest when you are tired, and keep exploring.  You just never know what you will find and what new and UNPLANNED fun you will have.</p>
