                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>How much should I plan to spend when eating out?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Disney is expensive.  A good rule of thumb is between $25 and $30 for adults, and $12 - $15 for children.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Where do I get coffee in the morning?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">You can make coffee in you room if you want, but you need to make sure that you buy some coffee grounds.  In addition, there is a coffee shop in the Wyndham Grand Hotel at Bonnet Creek on the lobby level.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Can I cook in the room?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">You bet!  The kitchen is a great size, and fully stocked!  Unless you are planning on stir frying in a wok, you should have just about everything you need.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>How do we get food for the room?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">We usually rent a car and make a trip to Walmart on the first day to get all you need for the week.  The key is planning ahead.  Make out your list based on your restaurant schedule.  We find that we almost always get too many groceries compared to amount of times we eat out.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Do I need to get dishwashing soap or laundry soap?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">No, there are samples in the room, and you can purchase more at the front desk.  Michelle may get some and everyone can split it as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Do I need to bring warm clothes?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Wear your warm clothes (jeans and sweatshirt) on the travel to Disney World.  It’s a good idea to have one pair of jeans and a sweatshirt.  Sweatshirts at Disney are not cheap!</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>What kind of pool shoes?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Nothing complicated… flip flops are awesome for all purpose shoes for the week.  Might want to consider water-shoes for the kids just in the interest of reducing stubbed-toes down at the pool.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Are sunglasses a must?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Without a doubt, and ESPECIALLY for the kids.  You may want to consider getting cords for the glasses as well, since you will have them with you just about everywhere you go.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Should we bring a stroller?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Without a doubt.  It’s not cheap to rent them in the parks, and you will want to have a stroller for other trips (like Downtown Disney) as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Can I smoke pot at Disney World?  I mean, I AM from Colorado.</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Disney has designated smoking areas.  But the Florida authorities would arrest you tree-huggers for smoking Mary Jane.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>What rides should I ride?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">That’s entirely up to you.  Visit the Disney World website to go through and find what you want to do.  If you are logged in, you can also mark things as “favorites” as well, which makes it easier to research later.  Also be cognizant of ride heights, as some rides that may seem as though would not have a height restriction actually DO.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Do I need my tickets?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">My recommendation is, even if you have activated your Magic Bands, that you should still bring your ticket-cards with you.  If there is an issue at the front gate, at least you will still be able to get in.  Also, with your smart phone, TAKE A PICTURE OF BOTH SIDES OF YOUR TICKET.  Although Guest Services is not required to replace lost or stolen tickets—this is mentioned in the fine print—but if you have a photo of your tickets as proof, they will usually replace them free of charge.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>In the parks, what if we need something to drink?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Most stands/etc. are required to give you a free cup of ice-water.  I would recommend bringing your water bottle and seeing if they will fill that up as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>The Magic Band is too big for the kids.  What do I do?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">You can peel-out the color part of the Magic Band so that it will fit little arms.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>How do I know when/where to meet characters?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">You can check online before you start your day in the park.  However, I recommend using the My Disney Experience app on your phone.  You can check throughout the day that way.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>I’d like to do email/etc. in the room.  Is there a connection?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Yes, bring your laptop.  There is internet in the room.  It’s a bit on the unpredictable side.  But as long as you aren’t planning on doing work that requires timely data transfer, you should be fine.  Also, if you plan to watch Netlix on your iPad, don’t get your hopes up.  The connection speed is being shared too broadly in the building, so it’s just not that fast.  You’ll end up with a frustrated toddler for sure.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>How much of the planning should I share with the kids?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">As much as possible.  Setting expectations up front about where you are going and what you are doing will help prevent some of the disappointment of not going somewhere specific.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>If I get too hot, can I wear a wife-beater instead?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">By all means, but the Riley’s probably won’t hang out with you.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Can I mail stuff ahead?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Honestly, I don’t know.  You could call Bonnet Creek and ask, but I would not recommend it.  Just travel light!</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>I’m jazzed about going to Disney.  Can I fulfill all of my dreams first time around?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">No.  Don’t get your hopes up about doing everything (or even 10% of everything).  You need to keep your expectations very realistic about the stuff that you can do.  You could probably go 10 times and still not have seen or done everything at Disney World.  If you keep your “fun” tied to living for enjoyable experiences with your family, rather than on quantity of activities, you’ll be all set.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Are you expecting me to have fun at Disney World?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">That’s up to you.  But if you aren’t going to have fun, then stay in your room.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>How can we avoid crowds?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Honestly, not going to Magic Kingdom on Monday is about the best thing that we can do.  People that go to Disney stay for a week, and almost always go to Magic Kingdom on Monday.  Also, the beginning of May is nearly perfect as well.  Kids are still in school (although you wouldn’t know it by looking around the parks!) and the heat hasn’t had a chance to really set in.  In addition, May isn’t very wet, so chances are the weather will be great as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>What’s the right balance between planning and spontaneity?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">You are with us, and we’ve figured that out.  Dining at Disney requires knowing where you will be, and that requires a daily plan.  Apart from the dining reservations, doing a schedule of other activities is not recommended.  I tried to do that the first time that we went, and that lasted for about 12 hours before I became completely frustrated.  Stick with the dining times, and aside from that, go with the flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>How do we know if you actually read this?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">You’ll comment on some of the FAQ’s.  If you don’t, you just wasted my time.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>What if someone gets lost?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">That’s very scary for us parents for sure.  But rather than planning for it not to happen, have a discussion with your little ones about what to do if that happens.  Being explicit with them about a plan is better than not having one.  You might want to give them a note/etc. that they can carry in their pocket with your mobile number, their name, etc. just in case.  Better yet, pin something visible to their clothes with the same information.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Any more information about the stroller?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Yes.  There is “stroller parking” at nearly every attraction.  You will be leaving your stroller in a sea of toddler transports.  So you might want to put something unique on the stroller to help you find it.  In addition, strollers larger than 36" x 52" are not allowed.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Can I bring an AK47 or M16 into Magic Kingdom?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">No</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>I keep hearing about Magic Hours at the park.  Can we take advantage of that?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Magic Hours are when the park opens earlier or stays open later for guests.  You can only do that if you stay at a Disney World Resort… that’s not us.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>What about hurricanes?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">May is not hurricane season in Florida.  This should be fine.  However, last year there was a brewing tropical storm in late April.  But for the most part it's not an issue.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Can I eat at a restaurant in a park without a ticket to that park?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">No.  You have to have paid admission to the park to go to a restaurant there.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>When I was standing in line to purchase something, I heard the clerk ask “Do you want to have this put in your room?”.  Can I do that too?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">That is only for guests for the Disney Resorts.  You are NOT a guest staying at a Disney Resort.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Can I use MY Magic Band to pay for stuff where the Magic Band payment option is available?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Not currently.  That is only available to guests of Disney World Resorts because the billing goes to their ROOM, not a credit card directly.  Again, you are not a Disney World Resort guest this time.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Will I be charged if I don’t cancel my dining reservation and don’t show up?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">If you have secured the reservation with a credit care, the answer is yes.  In fact, you have up until 11:59pm the day before your arrival to cancel without a cancelation fee.  So plan ahead!</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Should I go on the Bonnet Creek Resort tour?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">No.  You have been warned.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>Should I do on the Disney Vacation Club tour in Downtown Disney?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Actually, I would recommend it.  It’s a couple of hours, and you get to see all of the mock-ups of the rooms.  In addition, the same people are NOT pushy at all, and you get ice-cream at the end.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="faq_item">
                <li class="faq_question"><button type="button">+</button>How can we save money at Disney World?</li>
                <li class="faq_answer">Honestly, we have worked this out to be just about the right balance of cost and 3.5 star experience.  If you spend your time trying to cut corners, you will be miserable.  So, set your budget, increase it by 20%, and suck it up and just have fun.</li>
