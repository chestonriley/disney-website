                <h2>Getting Around in Disney World</h2>
                <h3>What you need to know about selecting the right option for you</h3>

                <p>When planning for your Disney World adventure, you find that transportation is definitely one of the more expensive aspects of your magical vacation.  But the cold, hard fact is that the complex is far to big to walk anywhere (unless you are staying at the Boardwalk).  So considering what option to choose ahead of time can help you find the right balance between budget and "pain-in-the-neck" inconvenience.  It's just like anything else at Disney World:  You get what you pay for.</p>
                <p>After staying there several years now, we've experienced all of the transportation options, and I've come up with some pros and cons for each of your transportation options.  It's important to note here that, most likely, your transportation decisions will NOT be made exclusive of other options.  Your transportation decisions will likely change day-to-day.</p>
                <p>Let's consider a list of potential options.  Click on each to see a list of pros and cons.</p>
                
                <div id="comparison_thumbnails_container">
                    <button class="comparison_thumbnail" id="rental_car_thumbnail">Rental Car pros/cons</button>
                    <button class="comparison_thumbnail" id="bus_system_thumbnail">Bus System pros/cons</button>
                    <button class="comparison_thumbnail" id="taxi_thumbnail">Taxi pros/cons</button>                
                </div>
                    
                <p>Leaving the comfort of the resort to do some exploring can definitely be a bit stressful from the point of view of actually getting from place to place.  We find that the taxi option is the best balance of price vs. stress.  Last year's taxi driver experience was pretty bad for us, but at least you know what you are expecting, which is 90% of the battle.</p>
